            <h2>What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?</h2>
           <p> That i can get frustrated pretty quickly when i get stuck. Learning to recognize and try to neutralise it has been valuable. That I don’t like asking for help, still something i'm working on.  
               Being told to take it easy on the self criticism has revealed how normal it was for me to focus negatively, getting out of that habit will be well worth it.</p>
              <h2>What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</h2>
              <p> The above human skills have  huge roles given the actual working environment in the industry  will be working  closely in  teams.</p>
              <h2> What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h2>
              <p> Just the overall importance it plays in securing a job. I kinda assumed it was not at the same level of importance as the 
                  practical coding skills but i'm now starting to recognise its at least level with these coding skill we are learning too. </p>
              
 
              <h2> What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h2>
              <p> Having to do introspection on my own values was not as easy to express as i first would have thought. I know what they are but
                having to sit down and convey them over a couple paragraphs to people i've never meet wasn’t that straightforward .</p> 
              <h2> Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</h2>
              <p> Because it's likely the deciding factor in who gets picked to join a team and have a job.</p>
              <h2>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.</h2>
              <p> No, I don't think it was a waste of time, again iterating on the previous points that its the human skill that will get you through the door in a job interview, especially at an entry level job. </p>
