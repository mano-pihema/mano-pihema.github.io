      <h1>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h1>

      <p> Currently I'm not sure if I would want to have a full time coding job, but a freelance type set up would be nice. 
      Something where I could still do my freelance film jobs but also be taking on coding jobs. I see coding work as a gradual transition away from film work.</p> 

      <h1> A description of your strengths and limitations concerning learning</h1>
          <p> My strengths that I can see when it comes to learning are perseverance and adaptability. Given that I've worked a wide range of different roles across a range of different industries, learning quickly adapting and  being observant has been strengths that I have had to harness pretty often.
            Perseverance kind of goes hand in hand with the above, when you learn a new skill your never going to get it right the first time, so keeping on it is something that has become second nature for me. 
            This also is a double edged sword and segways to my biggest limitation, which is not asking for help when i probably should. </p>
     
     <h1> What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy? </h1>
        <p> Building on the last point, I think the most important human skill I can develop is getting more comfortable with asking others when I'm stuck. 
          Usually I will eventually just grind my way through a problem but for such a quick program it's probably best to just fold and ask a bit faster. </p>
       
      <h1>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:</h1>
        <h3> An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives</h3>
          <p> I will manage the workload by building good habits, keeping on top of my health for example going on walks and taking breaks when needed. Eating well during this time will help physically and mentally.
              I will continue to manage my timeboxes, and if I'm going over I will then ask for help. </p>
     <h1> What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you</h1>
          <p> The best thing for me in this instance would be to take a break from the screen and go for a quick walk. </p>
     <h1> A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</h1>
          <p> During foundations I imagine the best place is the discord channels. If we are on campus then discord could still be an option but it’ll probably be faster to ask one of the teaching staff onsite.  </p>
     <h1> A description of what you expect from the facilitation team</h1>
          <p> Just facilitation, I don't expect too much hand holding. More like just guiding me down the path. Helpful when needed but I realise like 80 percent of the job is up to me.
              My learning goals and intentions are all my own responsibility as is my success in this course. </p>
     <h1> Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. 
          For example, you might have whānau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.</h1>
          <p> I don’t have any family commitments in the near future so I'm good on this front. </p>
