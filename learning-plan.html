        <h1>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h1>
        <p class="update">
          Again I still believe the goal in terms of career is to continue as a freelancer so
           that I can continue to take on film jobs whenever that might occur. If it turns out that a 
           great coding job comes up but it needs to be done full time then I would definitely consider full time coding. 
           However my ideal set up would be as a freelancer so i can continue in coding, film and eventually art making. 

        </p>

        <p> Currently I'm not sure if I would want to have a full time coding job, but a freelance type set up would be nice. 
        Something where I could still do my freelance film jobs but also be taking on coding jobs. I see coding work as a gradual transition away from film work.</p> 
         
        <h1> A description of your strengths and limitations concerning learning</h1>
          <p class="update">I still think perseverance is a core strength of mine as it has seen me through most of the bootcamp challenges, 
            however I have learned to be a bit more strategic with my time. When I am properly stuck instead of continuing to bash my head against it 
            I now circle around and try to come back after achieving another challenge.Sometimes the learning from these latter challenges address the prior challenge. 


          </p>
          
            <p> My strengths that I can see when it comes to learning are perseverance and adaptability. Given that I've worked a wide range of different roles across a range of different industries, learning quickly adapting and  being observant has been strengths that I have had to harness pretty often.
              Perseverance kind of goes hand in hand with the above, when you learn a new skill your never going to get it right the first time, so keeping on it is something that has become second nature for me. 
              This also is a double edged sword and segways to my biggest limitation, which is not asking for help when i probably should. </p>
      
      <h1> What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy? </h1>

      <p class="update">
          The ability to speak confidently in front of groups and also the ability to ask for help more often. 
          I think being on campus will aid my confidence in asking for help,  as for me asking in person is much easier than over discord.
           It's also much easier to describe the problem. Improving self awareness and reflecting on how my communication may effect others is 
           also a skill that i would like to nurture. 


      </p>
          <p> Building on the last point, I think the most important human skill I can develop is getting more comfortable with asking others when I'm stuck. 
            Usually I will eventually just grind my way through a problem but for such a quick program it's probably best to just fold and ask a bit faster. </p>
        
         <h1>What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</h1>
         <p class="update"> Communicating clearly and calmly. In the past when i’ve done projects with 
           tight deadlines especially toward the end my coms can be pretty poor. Both in descriptive quality and frequency. 
           So this will be a major goal for me to achieve, continuing clear calm comms during the crunches. </p>

        <h1>What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</h1>
        <p class="update"> Maybe a bit more in terms of teaching, as compared to the foundations team,
           but I still expect to be the one in charge of my own learning. 
          So in summary I am still taking responsibility for my learning but with a bit more input from the Bootcamp team,
           at least initially. Probably less and less as we approach the end of the course .</p>


        <h1>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:</h1>
          <h3> An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives</h3>
          <p class="update">
            My commitment continues to be to maintain good health, by keeping on top of diet and exercise needs.
             However this time being on campus will require more self awareness and awareness of others, so basically applying the human skills we learned about. 
              If all of these conditions are met then productivity and safely of all involved is very likely. 


          </p>
            <p> I will manage the workload by building good habits, keeping on top of my health for example going on walks and taking breaks when needed. Eating well during this time will help physically and mentally.
                I will continue to manage my timeboxes, and if I'm going over I will then ask for help. </p>
      <h1> What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you</h1>
            <p> The best thing for me in this instance would be to take a break from the screen and go for a quick walk. </p>
      <h1> A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</h1>
            <p> During foundations I imagine the best place is the discord channels. If we are on campus then discord could still be an option but it’ll probably be faster to ask one of the teaching staff onsite.  </p>
      <h1> A description of what you expect from the facilitation team</h1>
            <p> Just facilitation, I don't expect too much hand holding. More like just guiding me down the path. Helpful when needed but I realise like 80 percent of the job is up to me.
                My learning goals and intentions are all my own responsibility as is my success in this course. </p>
      <h1> Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. 
            For example, you might have whānau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.</h1>
            <p> I don’t have any family commitments in the near future so I'm good on this front. </p>
