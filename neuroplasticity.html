            <h1> Research Neuroplasticity</h1>
             <h2> Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people.</h2>
              <p> Understanding and taking on board the  ideas of neuroplasticity removes the limits that people may have previously placed on themselves.For 
                  instance doubt about whether they are able to do some task , such as drawing. When it is understood that the brain is adaptable, 
                  hopefully that person resolves to carry on learning to draw, as it is only a matter of time and practise.  </p>
             <h2> Discuss how you might engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for your benefit.</h2>
             <p> Forming new beneficial habits is the most basic and effective means of using neuroplasticity to your own advantage. One 
                 example might be getting to bed by a certain time. As this is practised over the long term, it becomes normal
                 and the full host of benefits that come with being well rested are reaped. </p>
             <h2> What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?</h2>
             <p> Creating a stimulating environment for your brain is the best way to increase neuroplasticity. Challenge the brain by taking up 
                 activities such as learning a new language, learning an instrument, or  doing a sudoku. </p>

             <h1> Research Growth Mindset</h1>
             <h2> Discuss what it is and why it is relevant.</h2>
             <p> Growth mindset is an outlook that  does not shy away from hard work, and in fact understands that hard work is the path to mastery. 
             They remain curious and motivated in the face of challenging tasks. Seeing these tasks as an opportunity to learn and grow. Feedback will be seen as constructive and not as an attack. </p>
             <h2>In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?</h2> 
             <p> I don’t know, it all seems pretty clear. Its relevance to my own journey through coding is not lost either. 
               I guess the only thing that has changed is me allowing myself a bit of patience to pick this stuff up.</p>

             <h2>How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?</h2> 
             <p> I think the best growth mindset skill for me to integrate would be my ability to accept criticism. I think my tendency to shield myself
              has led to avoiding asking for help from others earlier during code challenges. </p>

             <h1> Blend with your learning plan and strategies</h1>
             <h2> Reflect and discuss how these understandings may shape or influence your learning plan and strategy.</h2>
             <p> As I mentioned above my priority around learning should be focused on getting comfortable  reaching out to others,
               or at least facilitators earlier on. This comes with the caveat that as of yet i don’t think i’ve seriously needed to 
               reach out as i’ve finished all the code challenges mostly on my own.But as things become more difficult it may not be feasible timewise to grind it out solo. </p>
