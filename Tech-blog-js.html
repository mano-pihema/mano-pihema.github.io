              <h2> An analogy to describe the differences between HTML and CSS </h2>
                  <p> I  have already postulated the ‘monkey riding capybara’ model to describe the difference and interaction of HTML and CSS. 
                    If your after another one I might turn to house building. Here the restraints of site, environment, and structural integrity  are the Html. 
                    These factors are pretty much baked in and are your base for building your house. Your choice of cladding, the colour, architectural style  
                    etc are all aspects that can be manipulated and altered in the design process. 
                    This is similar to the role of CSS.  HTML essentially acts as a base structure for the CSS which is concerned with the visual aspect of the page. 
                  </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h2>
                Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life, for example, 'waking up' or 'brushing your teeth'. (But not those).

              </h2>
                <p>
                  A daily process that may help to illustrate loops is commuting. Say you are a freelancer and have a job that lasts 10 days. 
                  You will continue to commute each morning until you complete 10 days after which you won’t commute anymore. 
                  After each successful commute to the job you are paid for that day’s work.
                  In much the same way a loop will be initialised or contracted in a conditional and  continue while it has a ‘job’, 
                  or rather until the conditional is satisfied. After each time the conditional is satisfied the final expression is run.
                  In our analogy this is your day rate being paid for that day.(it's never that prompt though.)

              <h2>
                Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with it.

              </h2>
              <p>
                The acronym  DOM  means the Document Object Model. 
                The DOM is an object representation of your HTML document . Each object starting at the window, document,html,head. 
                The various tags from the html document are called nodes. Nodes include head tags, comments , attributes, everything from the html doc. 
                The browser creates these objects from your html Doc to make modification easy.

                Every HTML element you have made has a javascript equivalent. An Object equivalent. Javascript and the DOM allows dynamic modification and customisation.

              <h2>
                Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.

              </h2>
              <p>
                The differences start with purpose, objects are used to store the characteristics of a particular item in your code. 
                If you have an object named ‘Mike’ you may store characteristics such as ‘name, age, address’ that you want to alter or access from other parts of your code. 
                Arrays seem to be better at storing multiples of the same variable. Say if you wanted to store the age of everyone on ‘Mike’s street you would probably use an array. 
                They then store this data with an index number starting at 0. Whereas Objects store data in a key value pair.

              <h2>
                Explain what functions are and why they are helpful.

              </h2>
              <p>
                Functions are blocks of code that will execute a particular task when called. 
                Functions are useful because you can automate particular tasks by simply calling the function,
                 instead of having to write out all the instructions for each task over again. 
                 You can also nest functions inside of each other so that one can set off another if tasks need to happen in a particular way.
