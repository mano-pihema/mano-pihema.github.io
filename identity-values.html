     <p> Hurihia to aroaro ki te ra tukuna to atarangi kia taka ki muri i a koe” translates to “Turn your face to the sun and the shadows fall behind you” 
      This is about embracing a mindset where you turn negative situations into positive ones, thereby freeing yourself of those things real or perceived</p>

     <h1>Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make.Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made, and the consequences of your action. </h1>
      <p> 
          One day I was scanning out a couple of soft drinks at the supermarket. When I went to pay, one of the drinks scanned for only 1 cent. I could have told the checkout person but I didn't , and continued on with my day.
          I weighed my honesty and integrity against my dislike of countdown’s duopoly  and undue influence over the nation's food market. After thinking on this I decided with myself to take the small windfall.
         I was not caught so there were no immediate consequences. </p>
      
      
      
     <h1> Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity.</h1>
          <p>  Being Maori I have seen and experienced differences in treatment, especially in relation to large organisations across society. Police, justice, social services etc, all have imparted a level of distrust and cynicism. 
                On a more positive side my mother who was solo helped to instil values of perseverance, honesty and humility but also allowed us to follow whichever dream we wished for.
                 She also impressed the bond of family, how it was necessary for us all to work together. </p>
      
     <h1> Using the evidence gathered, describe your strengths and limitations.</h1>
     <p> Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and career development
      During my Honours year I believe perseverance played a huge role in completing that degree. There were many challenges during the final weeks of the course, but they were overcome by consistent effort. 
      This value did not provide me the same success however during my time as a cabinet maker. The difference was that cabinet making requires very high accuracy, so the idea that you can redo something will trip you up.
       Instead you must plan exactly how you intend to execute an action then evaluate what may go wrong and how to mitigate those outcomes. I learned that perseverance needs to be deployed with a strategy in mind. </p>
      
     <h1> Identify which of your strengths might help you in your learning journey and how they intersect with learning obstacles.</h1>
     <p> I think patience will be a key strength for the learning journey ahead. Practising it will keep me in a level mood when I'm not stuck or not understanding material. 
         It will also dovetail nicely with my strength in perseverance to prevent myself from becoming frustrated with repeated failure. </p>
      
      
     <h1> Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. 
     Discuss the strategies you used at that time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why</h1>
          <p> I  worked for some time with a guy whose English was pretty difficult to follow. The nature of the job required close cooperation and communication. This was hard to achieve because of the language barrier and I wasn't the best communicator either .
           Given that he was the more experienced between us I decided to back up and allow him to make more of the decisions. Which worked until there was a problem with our work, in which the boss would ask me to step up and take more leadership which landed me back at square one.
            Eventually we got paired off with other workers and gained more experience and confidence. Working with him after this was much better as there was now an established method. 
           I learned that trying to work as a team is impossible without effective communication and additionally,  common expectations. If I were to go back I would try to be more effective with my communication and let him know what I expected out of him. I would also be more clear with the boss . 
            I would also try to be more observant and proactive so that improvements could be made faster. </p>
