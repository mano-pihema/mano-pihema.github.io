      Above is a simple diagram representing an element’s margin, padding and border (which is represented by the red line.) I’ll go through each and what separates them.

    </p>
    
    <p>
      The padding is the area between an element’s content and the border.The padding sets the space inside the border , between the content. Tweaking this property can be useful when making buttons where you may want to change the distance between the text of the button and the edge of the button.  

      The border divides the element’s padding and its margin, here it's drawn in red. 
      
      The margin is the area outside the border. The margin sets the space outside the border, this is helpful when setting the space between elements.
      
      If I tried an analogy, say you have a fragile wine glass you’re sending to a friend . The glass is the content. While the newspaper you stuff around it is the padding. After a bit of gift wrap, which is the border. Lastly some bubble wrap for good measure which would be the margin.
