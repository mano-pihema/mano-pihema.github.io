            <h1> Tell your non-tech friend a story about a time you:</h1>
              <h2>were blocked on a simple problem.</h2>
                <h3> What was the problem?</h3>
                 <p> There was a loop that counted down, so that the first index element should be reached last. My initial code got 90% of this done except it wouldn’t 
                  call the first index. Of the four indexes it would call the 3rd,2nd, and last one.</p>   
              
              
                <h3> What problem-solving techniques did you use?</h3>
                  <p> A whole bunch of googling, watching videos about loops. Eventually i decided I was spending too much time on it so
                      I just bypassed it and decided to come back to it at the end. </p> 
                <h3>How did you feel throughout the process?</h3>
                  <p> It actually worked, the bypassing. I came back and solved it quickly after seeing a video which had a similar problem. 
                  I think i was only looking at this video for something unrelated to the loop as well.</p>
                <h3>What did you learn?</h3>
                   <p> If you are properly stuck, giving the problem some time and space helps, but also you want to keep your ears pricked up to a solution that can pop out of nowhere</p>. 
              
                <h2> elegantly solved a problem.</h2> 
                  <h3> What was the problem?</h3>
                  <p> It was during the gradebook KATA. The getAverage function I was pretty happy with my solution. It asked you to
                      get an array of numbers and based off a name return that students average score. </p>
            
                  <h3> What problem-solving techniques did you use?</h3>
                      <p> A little pseudocode , a little rubber ducky, and a bunch of console logging. </p> 
                  <h3> How did you feel throughout the process?</h3>
                       <p> Actually on top of it. The logic that I was talking myself through actually helped up when it came to write it down so that was very satisfying. </p>
                  <h3> What did you learn?</h3>
                      <p> Staying cool, calm and collected does help, instead of getting amped up when something doesn't work straight off the bat. </p>

            <h1>  Reflect on how confident you feel using each of these problem-solving techniques/processes:</h1>
             <h2> Pseudocode</h2>
             <p> Can be useful to dump out all the approaches you have thought of. Is helpful when you want to take a break and come back ,
                as you can jump back in faster. Not super confident with this technique as I'm super inexperienced. Currently it’s only  moderately useful for planning a way forward. 
              Trying something</p>
             <h2> Rubber ducky method</h2>
             <p> Similar to the above where it helps to clarify your process by talking it out. Not very often used. And again isn’t fully
              useful because half the time I don't know what can be done much rather how it can done. </p>
             <h2> Reading error messages</h2>
              <p> Can be helpful, but again inexperience means I often don’t know what it's trying to tell me. This is where most googling begins. </p>
             <h2> Console.logging</h2>
             <p> Probably one of the most helpful debugging techniques, i’m fairly confident with this. Can get snagged when im expecting a value but only get ‘undefined’. </p>
            <h2>  Googling</h2>
             <p> Hit or miss, can resolve and issue quickly or lead you down rabbit holes that are a waste of time. Usefulness will increase as
              time goes on and I become more confident with the technical jargon</p>
             <h2> Asking your peers for help</h2>
            <p>  Very bad at this. I’ve yet to try it. Most of the time it's because I don't even know what to ask. And when i do get unstuck i  usual figure it out on my own. </p>
              
             <h2> Asking coaches for help</h2>
             <p> Again, thinking of what my actual problem is or what I need to do to solve the problem is quite difficult.
              Generally it's the last technique I'll try because the others will have gotten me through before I feel the need to reach out. </p> 
             <h2> Improving your process with reflection</h2>
             <p>I’ve started leaving notes in my code that reflect on the bits that work and how I may have reached them.This is to aid
                future use of these working code blocks but also to help root in my mind when and why something is succesful </p>
